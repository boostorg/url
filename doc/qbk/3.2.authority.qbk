[section Authority]

[heading Notation]

The authority is a hierarchical element which names an entity governing
the name space defined by the remainder of the URL. It divides into
three subcomponents:

[teletype]
```
    authority = [userinfo "@"] host [":" port]
```

* The `host` subcomponent of the authority can be a registered name or an IP address.
* The optional `port` number subcomponent is preceded by a colon ":"
* The optional `userinfo` subcomponent consists of a username and an optional password

In a URL, the authority component is always preceded by a double slash ("//").

[table Authority BNF [
    [
    [teletype]
    ```
    authority       = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

    userinfo        = user [ ":" [ password ] ]

    host            = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name

    port            = *DIGIT

    user            = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
    password        = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" )

    IP-literal      = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"

    reg-name        = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / "-" / ".")
    ```
    ]
]]

    [Return the port number of the host, if applicable.]
]]

[table Authority Observers [
    [Function]
    [Description]
][
    [[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.has_authority `has_authority`]]
    [Return true if an authority is present.]
][
    [[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_authority `encoded_authority`]]
    [Return the authority as a percent-encoded string.]
]]

[heading Observers]

The function [link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_authority `encoded_authority`] can
be used to obtain the authority from a __url_view__:

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_3]
][
[teletype]
```
    https://www.boost.org/users/download/
    scheme:        https
    has authority: 1
    authority:     www.boost.org
    path:          /users/download/
```
]]]

These functions do not throw. If the URL has no authority,
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_authority `encoded_authority`] returns an empty string.

The function [link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.has_authority `has_authority`] can be used to check
whether this empty string means there is no authority or an empty authority in the URL.

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_1]
][
[teletype]
```
    https:///path/to_resource
    scheme:        https
    has authority: 1
    authority:
    path:          /path/to_resource
```
]]
[[
[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_6]
][
[teletype]
```
    mailto://John.Doe@example.com
    scheme:        mailto
    has authority: 1
    authority:     John.Doe@example.com
    path:
```
]]]

Notice that there is no decoded counterpart of
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_authority `encoded_authority`].
The reason is any decoded character `/` could
make it ambiguous with the path component.

[heading Host]

The host subcomponent represents where resources
are located. The functions
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_host `encoded_host`]
and [link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.host `host`]
can be used to obtain the host from a __url_view__, while
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_host_and_port `encoded_host_and_port`]
allows us to directly obtain the host with the corresponding port number.

The host might be a registered name

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_8]
][
[teletype]
```
    https://john.doe@www.example.com:123/forum/questions/
    encoded host:  www.example.com
    host:          www.example.com
    host and port: www.example.com:123
    port:          123
    port number:   123
```
]]]

or an IP address

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_9]
][
[teletype]
```
    https://john.doe@192.168.2.1:123/forum/questions/
    encoded host:  192.168.2.1
    host:          192.168.2.1
    host and port: 192.168.2.1:123
    port:          123
    port number:   123
```
]]]

Although this is not mandatory, note that the encoded host is rarely
different from its encoded counterpart.
The function [link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.port_number `port_number`]
returns the decoded port as an integer.

Registered names usually need to be handled differently from IP addresses.
The function
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.host_type `host_type`]
can be used to identify which type of host is described in the URL.

[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_10]

When the [link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.host_type `host_type`]
matches an IP address, the functions
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.ipv4_address `ipv4_address`],
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.ipv6_address `ipv6_address`]
can be used to obtain the decoded addresses as integers.

[heading Userinfo]

The optional `userinfo` subcomponent consists of a user name and
an optional password. The function
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_userinfo `encoded_userinfo`]
can be used to retrieve the userinfo from a __url_view__. Analogous
functions are provided for the userinfo subcomponents.

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_11]
][
[teletype]
```
    https://john.doe:123456@www.somehost.com/forum/questions/

    has_userinfo:     1
    encoded_userinfo: john.doe:123456
    userinfo:         john.doe:123456

    encoded_user:     john.doe
    user:             john.doe

    has_password:     1
    encoded_password: 123456
    password:         123456
```
]]]

Analogous to other observers, the functions
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.has_userinfo `has_userinfo`] and
[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.has_password `has_password`] are provided
to differentiate empty components from absent components.

Note that there is no function `has_user`. The user component is available
whenever `userinfo` exists.

[note Although the specification allows the format `username:password`,
the password component should be used with care.

It is not recommended to transfer password data through URLs
unless this is an empty string indicating no password.]

[heading Authority View]

In contexts where an authority can appear by itself, the library provides the
__authority_view__, a read-only container to a non-owning character buffer
containing a valid authority.

As an example, the grammar for the
[@https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1 ['request-target]]
of an HTTP/1 CONNECT request uses
[@https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.3 ['authority-form]].
This is what such a request looks like:

[teletype]
```
     CONNECT www.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
```

In that case, we have an authority that cannot be parsed directly
with __parse_uri__ as a URL. Instead, we can use the analogous function
[link url.ref.boost__urls__parse_authority `parse_authority`] to
obtain an __authority_view__.

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_12]
][
[teletype]
```
    www.example.com:80

    encoded_host_and_port: www.example.com:80
    encoded_host:          www.example.com
    host:                  www.example.com
    port:                  80
    port number:           80

    has_userinfo:          0
    encoded_userinfo:
    userinfo:

    encoded_user:
    user:

    has_password:          0
    encoded_password:
    password:
```
]]]

The authority view provides the subset of observer member functions found in
__url_view__ which are relevant to the authority. However, when an authority
is parsed on its own, the leading double slashes ("//") are not present.

The following authority string is also valid for
[link url.ref.boost__urls__parse_authority `parse_authority`]:

[teletype]
```
    user:pass@www.example.com:443
```

[table [[Code][Output]] [[
[c++]
[snippet_parsing_authority_13]
][
[teletype]
```
    user:pass@www.example.com:443

    encoded_host_and_port: www.example.com:443
    encoded_host:          www.example.com
    host:                  www.example.com
    port:                  443
    port number:           443

    has_userinfo:          1
    encoded_userinfo:      user:pass
    userinfo:              user:pass

    encoded_user:          user
    user:                  user

    has_password:          1
    encoded_password:      pass
    password:              pass
```
]]]


[heading Use Cases]

Note that if an authority is present, the host is always defined even if it
is the empty string (corresponding to a zero-length ['reg-name] in the BNF).

[teletype]
```
  https:///path/to_resource
  \____/\/\_______________/
    |   |          |
scheme authority  path
```

[table
    [[Component]     [Value]                       ]
    [[URL]           [`https:///path/to_resource`] ]
    [[Scheme]        [`https`]                     ]
    [[Has authority] [Yes]                         ]
    [[Authority]     []                            ]
    [[Path]          [`/path/to_resource`]         ]
]

The authority component also influences how we should interpret the URL path.
If the authority is present, the path component must either be empty or begin
with a slash.

This is a common pattern where the path is empty:

[teletype]
```
    https://www.boost.org
    \___/   \___________/
    scheme    authority    (path is empty)
```

[table
    [[Component]     [Value]                       ]
    [[URL]           [`https://www.boost.org`]     ]
    [[Scheme]        [`https`]                     ]
    [[Has authority] [Yes]                         ]
    [[Authority]     [`www.boost.org`]             ]
    [[Path]          []                            ]
]

When both the authority and path exist, the path needs to begin with a slash:

[teletype]
```
    https://www.boost.org/users/download/
    \___/   \___________/\______________/
    scheme    authority        path (begins with a slash)
```

[table
    [[Component]     [Value]                                   ]
    [[URL]           [`https://www.boost.org/users/download/`] ]
    [[Scheme]        [`https`]                                 ]
    [[Has authority] [Yes]                                     ]
    [[Authority]     [`www.boost.org`]                         ]
    [[Path]          [`/users/download/`]                      ]
]

This rule also affects the path "`/`":

[teletype]
```
    https://www.boost.org/
    \___/   \___________/\/
    scheme    authority  path (begins with a slash)
```

[table
    [[Component]     [Value]                                   ]
    [[URL]           [`https://www.boost.org/`]                ]
    [[Scheme]        [`https`]                                 ]
    [[Has authority] [Yes]                                     ]
    [[Authority]     [`www.boost.org`]                         ]
    [[Path]          [`/`]                                     ]
]

When there is no authority component, the path cannot begin with an empty
segment. This means the path cannot begin with two slashes `//` to avoid these
characters being interpreted as the beginning of the authority component.

For instance, consider the following valid URL:

[teletype]
```
  mailto:John.Doe@example.com
  \____/ \__________________/
  scheme          path
```

[table
    [[Component]     [Value]                                   ]
    [[URL]           [`mailto:John.Doe@example.com`]           ]
    [[Scheme]        [`mailto`]                                ]
    [[Has authority] [No]                                      ]
    [[Authority]     []                                        ]
    [[Path]          [`John.Doe@example.com`]                  ]
]

Note how including a double slash would make the path be interpreted as the authority:

[teletype]
```
  mailto://John.Doe@example.com
  \____/ \____________________/
  scheme       authority
```

[table
    [[Component]     [Value]                                   ]
    [[URL]           [`mailto://John.Doe@example.com`]         ]
    [[Scheme]        [`mailto`]                                ]
    [[Has authority] [Yes]                                     ]
    [[Authority]     [`John.Doe@example.com`]                  ]
    [[Path]          []                                        ]
]

In complete authority components, we can also extract the `userinfo` and `port` subcomponents.

[teletype]
```
          userinfo       host      port
          /------\ /-------------\ /-\
  https://john.doe@www.example.com:123/forum/questions/
  \___/   \__________________________/\_______________/
  scheme          authority                  path
```

[table
    [[Component]     [Value]                                                   ]
    [[URL]           [`https://john.doe@www.example.com:123/forum/questions/`] ]
    [[Scheme]        [`https`]                                                 ]
    [[Has authority] [Yes]                                                     ]
    [[Authority]     [`john.doe@www.example.com:123`]                          ]
    [[Host]          [`www.example.com`]                                       ]
    [[Userinfo]      [`john.doe`]                                              ]
    [[Port]          [`123`]                                                   ]
    [[Path]          [`/forum/questions/`]                                     ]
