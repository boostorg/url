[section Grammars]

[heading Design of grammar rules]

The function [link url.ref.boost__urls__grammar__parse `parse`] implements the logic for parsing strings
according to grammar rules.

A grammar rule type, henceforth called a "rule", provides an algorithm for parsing an input string. An
instance of the rule is used to store the results.

[heading Customization points]

Users can define a free function `parse` as a customization point defining how to parse their
grammar rules as part of the same architecture that might include arbitrary grammar rules in expressions.

These new function overloads may be defined in other namespaces. As with __std_swap__, the design relies
on [@https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl argument-dependent lookup] to find these overloads.
