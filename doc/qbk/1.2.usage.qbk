[section Nomenclature]

This library standardizes on the term "URL" to refer to all strings which
follow the syntax in rfc3986. The reason is that the terms URI and IRI
cause confusion. In practice a single algorithm is used for both so
keeping them distinct yields little value. When discussing particular
grammars, the name of the grammar is used exactly as it appears in rfc3986.

[section BNF Notation]

This documentation uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
notation of
[@https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2234 rfc2234]
to specify particular grammars used by algorithms and containers. While
a complete understanding of the notation is not a requirement for using the
library, it may help for understanding how valid components of URLs are
defined. In particular, this will be of interest to users who wish to
compose parsing algorithms using the combinators provided by the library.

[section `result` Return Type]

In many places, functions in the library have a return type which uses the
__result__ alias template.
