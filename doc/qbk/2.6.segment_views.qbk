[section Segment Views]

[/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

The library provides two read-only containers for interacting with the segments
in a URL's path:

[table Segment View Types [
    [Type]
    [Description]
][
    [[link url.ref.boost__urls__segments_encoded_view `segments_encoded_view`]]
    [A read-only forward range of path segments returned as percent-encoded strings.]
][
    [[link url.ref.boost__urls__segments_view `segments_view`]]
    [A read-only forward range of path segments returned as strings with percent-decoding applied.]
]]

These containers are lightweight references to the underlying path string.
Ownership of the string is not transferred; the caller is responsible for
ensuring that the lifetime of the string extends until the container is
destroyed. Containers may not be constructed directly from strings.
Instead, they are created by the parsing functions below. This provides
the guarantee that all constructed views contain valid path segments:

[table Path Parsing Functions [
    [Function]
    [Grammar]

    [[link url.ref.boost__urls__parse_path `parse_path`]]
    [['any path]]

]]
