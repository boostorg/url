[section Magnet Link]

`magnet` is a URL scheme for identifying files by their content. These files are
usually identified by cryptographic hash value.

Magnet links are useful in peer-to-peer file sharing networks because they allow
resources to be referred to without the need for a continuously available host..

This example parses a magnet link into a new view type and prints its components to
standard output.
