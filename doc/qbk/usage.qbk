[section Usage]

[heading Nomenclature]

This library standardizes on the term "URL" to refer to all strings which
follow the URI generic syntax. The reason is that the terms URI and IRI
are just confusing. In practice a single algorithm is used for both so
keeping them distinct is not helping anyone. 

[heading Syntax]

This documentation uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
notation of
[@https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2234 [RFC2234]]
including the following core ABNF syntax rules defined by that specification:
ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage return), DIGIT (decimal digits), DQUOTE (double
quote), HEXDIG (hexadecimal digits), LF (line feed), and SP (space).  The
complete URI syntax is described in
__RFC3986__.

[heading Return Type boost::system::result]

In many places, functions in the library have a return type which uses the
__result__ alias template.
