[section Overview]
[block'''<?dbhtml stop-chunking?>''']

[/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Boost.URL is a portable C++ library which provides containers and algorithms
which model a "URL", more formally described using the
[@https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]
specification (henceforth referred to as __rfc3986__). A URL is a compact sequence
of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource. For example,
this is a valid URL which satisfies the ['absolute-URI] grammar:

[teletype]
```
    https://www.example.com/path/to/file.txt?userid=1001&page=2&results=full
```

[/ Introduction to URL ]

This library understands the various grammars related to URLs and provides
functionalities for:

* validating and parsing of strings,
* manipulation of URL strings, and
* algorithms operating on URLs such as normalization and resolution.

[heading Features]

While the library is general purpose, special care has been taken to ensure
that the implementation and data representation are friendly to network
programs which need to handle URLs efficiently and securely, including the
case where the inputs come from untrusted sources.

Interfaces are provided for using error codes instead of exceptions as needed,
and all algorithms provide a mechanism for avoiding memory allocations entirely
if desired. Another feature of the library is that all container mutations leave the
URL in a valid state. Code which uses Boost.URL will be easy to read,
flexible, and performant.

Boost.URL offers these features:

* Require only C++11
* Works without exceptions
* Fast compilation, no templates
* Strict compliance with __rfc3986__
* Allocator control, including avoiding allocation entirely
* Optional header-only, without linking to a library
* Supports `-fno-exceptions`, detected automatically
* Link to a built static or dynamic Boost library, or use [link header-only header-only]
* Work well on [link embedded-devices embedded devices].

[section Requirements]

The library requires Boost 1.78 and a compiler supporting at least C++11.

[note
    Boost [*1.78] or higher is a requirement for installation of this library proposal.
]

Aliases for standard types, such as __string_view__, use their Boost equivalents.

[#header-only]
[heading Header-Only]

To use the library as header-only; that is, to eliminate the requirement to
link a program to a static or dynamic Boost.URL library, simply
place the following line in exactly one new or existing source
file in your project.

[c++]
```
    #include <boost/url/src.hpp>
```

[#embedded-devices]
[heading Embedded]

Boost.URL works great on embedded devices. It can be used in a
way that avoids all dynamic memory allocations. Furthermore it
is designed to work without exceptions if desired.

[section Supported Compilers]

Boost.URL has been tested with the following compilers:

* clang: 3.8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
* gcc: 4.8, 4.9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
* msvc: 14.0, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3

[h3 Quality Assurance]

The development infrastructure for the library includes
these per-commit analyses:

* Coverage reports
