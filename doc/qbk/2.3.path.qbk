[section Path]

The path contains data, usually organized hierarchically which is combined
with the ['query] (explained in the next section) to identify a resource
within the scope of the scheme and authority (if any). Most schemes
interpret the path as a sequence of slash delimited ['segments]. In
addition to interacting with the path as a single string, the library
provides container adaptors modeling ranges of individual path segments.
The URL below contains a path with three segments:
```
    http://www.example.com/path/to/file.txt
```

Depending on the type of URL, there are various syntactic rules for how the
path may be formulated in a URL. The BNF for these formulations is defined
thusly:

[table Path BNF [[
```
    path          = path-abempty    ; begins with "/" or is empty
                  / path-absolute   ; begins with "/" but not "//"
                  / path-noscheme   ; begins with a non-colon segment
                  / path-rootless   ; begins with a segment
                  / path-empty      ; zero characters

    path-abempty  = *( "/" segment )
    path-absolute = "/" [ segment-nz *( "/" segment ) ]
    path-noscheme = segment-nz-nc *( "/" segment )
    path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )
    path-empty    = 0<pchar>
```
]]]

The functions for interacting with the path in a __url_view__ are as follows:

[table Path Observers [
    [Function]
    [Description]
][
    [[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_path `encoded_path`]]
    [Return the path as a percent-encoded string]
][
    [[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.encoded_segments `encoded_segments`]]
    [Return the path segments as a read-only container of percent-encoded strings.]
][
    [[link url.ref.boost__urls__url_view.segments `segments`]]
    [Return the path segments as a read-only container of strings with percent-decoding applied.]
]]
