[section Authority View]

[/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

For contexts where an authority can appear by itself, the library provides the
__authority_view__, a read-only container to a non-owning character buffer
containing a valid authority. As an example, the grammar for the
[@https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1 ['request-target]]
of an HTTP/1 CONNECT request uses
[@https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.3 ['authority-form]].
An authority view cannot be constructed from a string directly. Instead, it
is returned from the function
[link url.ref.boost__urls__parse_authority `parse_authority`].

The authority view provides the subset of observer member functions found in
__url_view__ which are relevant to the authority. However, when an authority
is parsed on its own, the leading double slashes ("//") are not present. The
following authority string is valid for `parse_authority`:

[teletype]
```
    user:pass@www.example.com:443
```
