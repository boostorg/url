=== Description

pass:v,q[Objects of this type represent valid authority] pass:v,q[strings constructed from a parsed, external]
pass:v,q[character buffer whose storage is managed]
pass:v,q[by the caller. That is, it acts like a]
pass:v,q[`core::string_view` in terms of ownership.]
pass:v,q[The caller is responsible for ensuring]
pass:v,q[that the lifetime of the underlying]
pass:v,q[character buffer extends until it is no]
pass:v,q[longer referenced.]

=== Example 1
pass:v,q[Construction from a string parses the input]
pass:v,q[as an]
pass:v,q[authority]
pass:v,q[and throws an]
pass:v,q[exception on error. Upon success, the]
pass:v,q[constructed object points to the passed]
pass:v,q[character buffer; ownership is not]
pass:v,q[transferred.]
[,cpp]
----
authority_view a( "user:pass@www.example.com:8080" );
----

=== Example 2
pass:v,q[The parsing function]
xref:reference/boost/urls/parse_authority.adoc[parse_authority]
pass:v,q[returns]
pass:v,q[a]
pass:v,q[result]
pass:v,q[containing either a valid]
xref:reference/boost/urls/authority_view/2constructor-0e.adoc[authority_view]
pass:v,q[upon succcess, otherwise it]
pass:v,q[contain an error. The error can be converted to]
pass:v,q[an exception by the caller if desired:]
[,cpp]
----
system::result< authority_view > rv = parse_authority( "user:pass@www.example.com:8080" );
----

=== BNF
[,cpp]
----
authority     = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

userinfo      = user [ ":" [ password ] ]

user          = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
password      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" )

host          = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name

port          = *DIGIT
