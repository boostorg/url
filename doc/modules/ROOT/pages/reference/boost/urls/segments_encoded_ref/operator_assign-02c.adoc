=== Description

pass:v,q[The existing contents are replaced] pass:v,q[by a copy of the other segments.]
pass:v,q[All iterators are invalidated.]
[NOTE]
pass:v,q[None of the character buffers referenced]
pass:v,q[by `other` may overlap the buffer of the]
pass:v,q[underlying url, or else the behavior]
pass:v,q[is undefined.]

=== Complexity
pass:v,q[Linear in `other.buffer().size()`.]

=== Exception Safety
pass:v,q[Strong guarantee.]
pass:v,q[Calls to allocate may throw.]
