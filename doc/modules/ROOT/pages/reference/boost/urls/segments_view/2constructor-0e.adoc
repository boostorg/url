=== Description

pass:v,q[This function constructs segments from] pass:v,q[a valid path string, which can contain]

pass:v,q[Upon construction, the view references]
pass:v,q[the character buffer pointed to by `s`.]
pass:v,q[caller is responsible for ensuring]
pass:v,q[that the lifetime of the buffer]
pass:v,q[extends until the view is destroyed.]

----
return parse_path( s ).value();
