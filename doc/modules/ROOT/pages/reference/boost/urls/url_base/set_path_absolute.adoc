== set_path_absolute

pass:v,q[Set if the path is absolute]


=== Synopsis

[source,cpp,subs="verbatim,macros,-callouts"]
----
bool
set_path_absolute(bool absolute);
----

Declared in file <include/boost/url/url_base.hpp> on line 1665

Defined in file <src/url_base.cpp> on line 1011

=== Description

pass:v,q[This function adjusts the path to make] pass:v,q[it absolute or not, depending on the]
pass:v,q[parameter.]
[NOTE]
pass:v,q[If an authority is present, the path]
pass:v,q[is always absolute. In this case, the]
pass:v,q[function has no effect.]

=== Example
[,cpp]
----
url u( "path/to/file.txt" );
assert( u.set_path_absolute( true ) );
assert( u.buffer() == "/path/to/file.txt" );
----

=== Postconditions
[,cpp]
----
this->is_path_absolute() == true && this->encoded_path().front() == '/'
----

=== Complexity
pass:v,q[Linear in `this->size()`.]

=== BNF
[,cpp]
----
path          = path-abempty    ; begins with "/" or is empty
              / path-absolute   ; begins with "/" but not "//"
              / path-noscheme   ; begins with a non-colon segment
              / path-rootless   ; begins with a segment
              / path-empty      ; zero characters

path-abempty  = *( "/" segment )
path-absolute = "/" [ segment-nz *( "/" segment ) ]
path-noscheme = segment-nz-nc *( "/" segment )
path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )
path-empty    = 0<pchar>
