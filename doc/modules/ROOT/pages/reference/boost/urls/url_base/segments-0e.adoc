pass:v,q[Return the path as a container of segments]


=== Synopsis

[source,cpp,subs="verbatim,macros,-callouts"]
----
xref:reference/boost/urls/segments_ref.adoc[segments_ref]
segments() noexcept;

Declared in file <include/boost/url/url_base.hpp> on line 1851

Defined in file <src/url_base.cpp> on line 1325

=== Description

pass:v,q[This function returns a bidirectional] pass:v,q[view of segments over the path.]
pass:v,q[The returned view references the same]
pass:v,q[underlying character buffer; ownership]
pass:v,q[is not transferred.]
pass:v,q[Any percent-escapes in strings returned]
pass:v,q[when iterating the view are decoded first.]
pass:v,q[The container is modifiable; changes]
pass:v,q[to the container are reflected in the]
pass:v,q[underlying URL.]

=== Example
[,cpp]
----
url u( "http://example.com/path/to/file.txt" );

segments sv = u.segments();

=== Complexity
pass:v,q[Constant.]

=== Exception Safety
pass:v,q[Throws nothing.]

=== BNF
[,cpp]
----
path          = path-abempty    ; begins with "/" or is empty
              / path-absolute   ; begins with "/" but not "//"
              / path-noscheme   ; begins with a non-colon segment
              / path-rootless   ; begins with a segment
              / path-empty      ; zero characters

path-abempty  = *( "/" segment )
path-absolute = "/" [ segment-nz *( "/" segment ) ]
path-noscheme = segment-nz-nc *( "/" segment )
path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )
