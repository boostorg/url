Defined in file <include/boost/url/url_base.hpp> on line 1916

=== Description

pass:v,q[This function returns a bidirectional] pass:v,q[view of strings over the path.]
pass:v,q[The returned view references the same]
pass:v,q[underlying character buffer; ownership]
pass:v,q[is not transferred.]
pass:v,q[Strings returned when iterating the]
pass:v,q[range may contain percent escapes.]

=== Example
[,cpp]
----
segments_encoded_view sv = url_view( "/path/to/file.txt" ).encoded_segments();

=== Complexity
pass:v,q[Constant.]

=== Exception Safety
