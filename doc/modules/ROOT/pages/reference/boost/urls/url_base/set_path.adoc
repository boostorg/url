== set_path

pass:v,q[Set the path.]


=== Synopsis

[source,cpp,subs="verbatim,macros,-callouts"]
----
xref:reference/boost/urls/url_base.adoc[url_base]&
set_path(string_view s);
----

Declared in file <include/boost/url/url_base.hpp> on line 1731

Defined in file <src/url_base.cpp> on line 1092

=== Description

pass:v,q[This function sets the path to the] pass:v,q[string, which may be empty.]
pass:v,q[Reserved characters in the string are]
pass:v,q[percent-escaped in the result.]
[NOTE]
pass:v,q[The library may adjust the final result]
pass:v,q[to ensure that no other parts of the url]
pass:v,q[is semantically affected.]
[NOTE]
pass:v,q[This function does not encode '/' chars, which]
pass:v,q[are unreserved for paths but reserved for]
pass:v,q[path segments. If a path segment should include]
pass:v,q[encoded '/'s to differentiate it from path separators,]
pass:v,q[the functions]
xref:reference/boost/urls/url_base/set_encoded_path.adoc[set_encoded_path]
pass:v,q[or]
xref:reference/boost/urls/url_base/segments-04.adoc[segments]
pass:v,q[should be used instead.]

=== Example
[,cpp]
----
url u( "http://www.example.com" );

u.set_path( "path/to/file.txt" );

assert( u.path() == "/path/to/file.txt" );
----

=== Complexity
pass:v,q[Linear in `this->size() + s.size()`.]

=== Exception Safety
pass:v,q[Strong guarantee.]
pass:v,q[Calls to allocate may throw.]

=== BNF
[,cpp]
----
path          = path-abempty    ; begins with "/" or is empty
              / path-absolute   ; begins with "/" but not "//"
              / path-noscheme   ; begins with a non-colon segment
              / path-rootless   ; begins with a segment
              / path-empty      ; zero characters

path-abempty  = *( "/" segment )
path-absolute = "/" [ segment-nz *( "/" segment ) ]
path-noscheme = segment-nz-nc *( "/" segment )
path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )
path-empty    = 0<pchar>
