Declared in file <include/boost/url/url_base.hpp> on line 1912

Defined in file <src/url_base.cpp> on line 1332

=== Description

pass:v,q[This function returns a bidirectional] pass:v,q[view of segments over the path.]
pass:v,q[The returned view references the same]
pass:v,q[underlying character buffer; ownership]
pass:v,q[is not transferred.]
pass:v,q[Strings returned when iterating the]
pass:v,q[range may contain percent escapes.]
pass:v,q[The container is modifiable; changes]
pass:v,q[to the container are reflected in the]
pass:v,q[underlying URL.]

=== Example
[,cpp]
----
url u( "http://example.com/path/to/file.txt" );

segments_encoded_ref sv = u.encoded_segments();
----

=== Complexity
pass:v,q[Constant.]

=== Exception Safety
pass:v,q[Throws nothing.]

=== BNF
[,cpp]
