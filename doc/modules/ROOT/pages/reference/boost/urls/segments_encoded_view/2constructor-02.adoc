== segments_encoded_view

pass:v,q[Constructor]


=== Synopsis

[source,cpp,subs="verbatim,macros,-callouts"]
----
segments_encoded_view(string_view s);
----

Declared in file <include/boost/url/segments_encoded_view.hpp> on line 167

Defined in file <src/segments_encoded_view.cpp> on line 28

=== Description

pass:v,q[This function constructs segments from] pass:v,q[a valid path string, which can contain]
pass:v,q[percent escapes.]
pass:v,q[Upon construction, the view references]
pass:v,q[the character buffer pointed to by `s`.]
pass:v,q[caller is responsible for ensuring]
pass:v,q[that the lifetime of the buffer]
pass:v,q[extends until the view is destroyed.]

=== Example
[,cpp]
----
segments_encoded_view ps( "/path/to/file.txt" );
----

=== Effects
[,cpp]
----
return parse_path( s ).value();
----

=== Postconditions
[,cpp]
----
this->buffer().data() == s.data()
----

=== Complexity
pass:v,q[Linear in `s`.]

=== Exception Safety
pass:v,q[Exceptions thrown on invalid input.]

=== BNF
[,cpp]
----
path = [ "/" ] [ segment *( "/" segment ) ]

segment = *pchar
