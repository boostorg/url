= String Token

Functions which perform percent-decoding return values using cpp:std::string[] when called without special arguments.
This is the best default for ergonomics, and a good enough default for performance considering that many decoded strings fit in the small buffer available to most standard implementations.
Some use-cases may desire more control over how these algorithms acquire and store data in strings, for example:

* Returning a string using a non-default allocator
* Reusing the storage of an existing string
* Appending to existing strings

The library provides a special customization mechanism called
__StringToken__ to control how algorithms which require an output buffer acquire their storage.
